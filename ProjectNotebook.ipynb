    "\n",
    "My Project is a data creation tool on baseball statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code asks the user for an input of whether or not the player is a hitter or a pitcher and then asks for the respected inputs based on that. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Useage\n",
    "\n",
    "After the user inputs their desired numbers, the code will return \n",
    "statistics used by the MLB and a player with similar statistics along with that. (Based on their statistics as of 6/10/2024)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Below I have included three examples, one of Fernando Tatis Jr.'s actual stats, one of a hitter, and also one of a pitcher. The code is already ran but I left an empty cell with the function in it so run the code and input your own numbers to see the statistics be calculated :)\n",
    "\n",

    "## Knowledge \n",

    "This code would work a lot better if the user has prior knowledge of baseball but it works fine if you dont."

Originally my project was just going to be hitting statistics but then I decided I wanted to make it a whole interactive bot where it will return a players statistics based on user input. I think my implementation of having both hitting and pitching statistics doubled my workload for this project and is deserving of extra credit. Along with this, I was just going to stop at returning the statistics but decided to go above and beyond by adding the portion where it returns a padres player the user player is similar to. This by far was the most challenging part of the code and I spent multiple hours trying to make it run correctly when I could have just stopped at the statistics part of the project."
